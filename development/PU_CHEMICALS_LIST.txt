Chemicals needed and/or used in all types of PU materials
(flexible foam, rigid foam, moulded foam, TPU, CASE: coatings, adhesives, sealants, elastomers)

Primary reactants

  Isocyanates: MDI, TDI, HDI, H12MDI, IPDI (aromatic and aliphatic isocyanates).

  Polyols: polyether polyols, polyester polyols, acrylic polyols.


Processing and performance

  Catalysts: amine catalysts, tin catalysts (drive isocyanate-polyol reaction).

  Blowing agents: used to create foam structure (flexible, rigid, moulded foam).

  Surfactants: silicones and others for foam structure and processing.

  Chain extenders: modify polymer properties and structure.


Additives and modifiers

  Flame retardants.

  Fillers, pigments.

  Mold release agents.

  Solvents (where used in formulations).
