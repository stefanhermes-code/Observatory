Polyurethane Industry Observatory – Pricing 

Pricing Principles 

      • Pricing is per user, per month 

      • Cadence reflects depth and urgency, not raw cost 

      • Scope (companies / regions / value‑chain links) determines the package tier 

      • All plans include access to the full Observatory platform and editorial methodology
