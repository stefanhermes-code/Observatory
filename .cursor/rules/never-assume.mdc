# Never assume

- **Do not assume** the user wants particular constraints (e.g. payload limits, retrieval limits, timeouts, caps).
- **Do not add** limits, validations, or behavior "for safety" or "to avoid timeouts" unless the user explicitly asks for them or they already exist in the codebase.
- If in doubt, **ask** what the user wants instead of implementing a guess.
- When explaining past work, do not present assumptions as if they were user requirements.
