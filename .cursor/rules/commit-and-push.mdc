# Commit and push after code changes

When you complete code changes in this repo:

1. **Stage** only the files you changed (e.g. `git add path/to/file.py`), not unrelated or untracked files.
2. **Commit** with a clear message that describes what was done (e.g. "Add X" / "Fix Y" / "Refactor Z").
3. **Push** to the current branch (`git push`).

Do this as part of the same task—do not wait for the user to ask. If the user has no remote or prefers not to push, the push step may fail; that is acceptable.

Use PowerShell-compatible commands in this workspace (e.g. `Set-Location` and `;` instead of `&&` for chaining, or run commands separately).
