# Commit and push after code changes

When you complete code changes in this repo:

1. **Stage** only the files you changed (e.g. `git add path/to/file.py`), not unrelated or untracked files.
2. **Commit** with a clear message that describes what was done (e.g. "Add X" / "Fix Y" / "Refactor Z").
3. **Push** to the current branch (`git push`).

**Always** do this in the same turn as your code changes—never leave commit/push for the user to request. Before you reply "done" or end your response, if you modified any tracked files, you must have already run git add, commit, and push. If the user has no remote or prefers not to push, the push step may fail; that is acceptable.

Use PowerShell-compatible commands in this workspace (e.g. `Set-Location` and `;` instead of `&&` for chaining, or run commands separately).
